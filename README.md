# Maintainers
This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

### Installation
Open Libra core prefers Bun over NPM and Yarn: https://bun.sh/
```
$ bun install
```

### Local Development

```
$ bun run start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
$ bun run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.
